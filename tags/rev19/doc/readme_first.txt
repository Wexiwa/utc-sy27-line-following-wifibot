How to use this documentation files:

1 - 	start with rtmaps_4_wifibot_sdk_quickstart.pdf which explains the folders 
	structure and how to generate your first project and RTMaps 4 Wifibot 
	components thanks to the wizards.

2 - 	then read rtmaps_developer_manual.pdf. This is the SDK step by step 
	manual from the full RTMaps version.
	It introduces step by step the RTMaps API and concepts.

	NOTE : 
	There are a few differences with the RTMaps 4 Wifibot SDK, like concerning 
	the folder tree and use of the Visual Studio wizards which differ slightly.
	Ignore chapters 1.3 and 1.4 for example.
	Also ignore chapters 2.3 about Record/Replay methods since record and playback 
	functionalities are not available in RTMaps 4 Wifibot.

3 - 	finally the rtmaps_sdk_reference.pdf presents the complete list of funtions, 
	classes, etc... of the RTMaps (generated by Doxygen).
